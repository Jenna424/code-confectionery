Many-to-Many Relationship between Cakes and Layers:
- A single cake has_many layers
- A single layer can be used in many cakes

A layer is categorized as one of two options:
1). batter (e.g. "vanilla sponge", "chocolate sponge", "marble", "carrot", "red velvet")
2). filling (e.g. "chocolate mousse", "lemon custard", "fudge", "whipped cream", "strawberry preserves", "bavarian cream")

Layers must alternate between batter and filling to keep the cake's structure stable.
